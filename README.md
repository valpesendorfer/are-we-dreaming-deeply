**Code exchange for s-boeck and valpesendorfer. Naming of the repository is open for discussion.**


## Current changes and status

I created a complete function for HAND incorporating the code we were working on. The function requires following inputs:
- DEM
- Flow direction (D8)
- Flow accumulation (D8)
- Accumuation threshold (optional - if not set, it will be set iteratively with user inputs)
